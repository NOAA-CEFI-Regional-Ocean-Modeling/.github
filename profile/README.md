NOAA is embarking on an ambitious effort, the Climate, Ecosystems and Fisheries Initiative ([CEFI](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/topic/climate-change/climate,-ecosystems,-and-fisheries)), to develop and deploy a nation-wide ocean modeling, prediction, and decision support system to meet the challenge of coastal ecosystem management in a changing climate.
